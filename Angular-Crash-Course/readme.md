# Angular Crash Course  
__Observables__   
Observables are included with RxJS which is reactive extension...   
When we use a service and we make a HTTP request to an API we usually return an observable to the component and subscribe to that observable.

__Angular CLI Opeations__
Create new Angular application  
`$ ng new myapp`    
Run the development server  
`$ ng serve`  
Built the static assets   
`$ ng build`  
Generate a component  
`$ ng generate component todo`  
Generate a service  
`$ ng generate service todo`  
Generate a module  
`$ ng generate module app-routing`  

You can use state management like `ngrx` and `Redux` with Angular for larger applications.
